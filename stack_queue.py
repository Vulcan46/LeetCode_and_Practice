# stacks can be implemented as linked lists or dynamic arrays.
# dynamic arrays are the most common in practical usage
# append, pop, peek ( what,s on the top?), isempty T/F: if stack -> that's how
# it's done in python
# Stacks are LIFO


# queues are FIFO
# pop is from 1st index
# add (enqueue) is still at last index
# implemented using linked lists generally
